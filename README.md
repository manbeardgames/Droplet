# Droplet
Droplet was made for Ludum Dare 40.  I have provided the source code here for anyone under the MIT license (see license information at the bottom).

## Description  
You are a small, tiny, insignificant droplet. Small as you may be, this doesn't discourage you from dreaming to be a bigger droplet.  As you consume those that stand in your way, you watch your self grow. But don't let your ego blind you, as there are always others out there, bigger and better than you, waiting to grow by consuming you. 

## How To Play
**Controls**

* **Movement**: The player follows the mouse courser.  Just move the mouse to get the player to move. 
* **Change Colors**: Left clicking will change the player color to white, and right clicking will change the player color to black.

**Mechanics**  
Players consume other circles that are smaller than themselves. If the circle is the same color as the player circle, then the player will grow slightly. If they are opposite colors, then they will shrink slightly.  

Consuming a circle, regardless of color, will add progress to the level bar at the bottom of the screen. The higher the level you reach, the more enemy circles that will spawn

## Ludum Conclusion
This was incredibly exciting for me.  I'm so proud to have finished this and be able to be apart of Ludum Dare.  I choose to use MonoGame to develop this, which I have only just recently in the past week started learning and working with.  

This is not only my first Ludum but my first game jam.  I had no idea, even with a simple idea, if I'd be able to finish in the time allowed.  I was incredibly nervous about this since I was also learning a new framework.

I streamed development and it was really great having people come in, giving suggestions, even some sending me early builds of their projects to try and and give feedback.  I hope to do this again for each time Ludum Dare comes around.  

Thanks for checking out the game
